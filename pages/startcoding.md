## How to create your own scripts

By default, PyCraft uses the example scripts that come with RaspberryJam Mod. There are several dozens, created by many different people who have made them freely available online. You are very welcome to use them, look at them, and once you feel confident, modify them as you like!

All the Python scripts which interact with Minecraft use a collection of other Python scripts called [mcpipy](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/2013/04/minecraft-pi-edition-api-tutorial.html), which handles all the difficult stuff, like connecting to your world and moving things around as you wish, you just have to tell it what you want.

There are many good sources to get started, plenty of [blogs](https://mcpipy.wordpress.com/) and [tutorials](http://www.instructables.com/id/Python-coding-for-Minecraft/) online. A really good self-contained guide detailing everything from setting up your computer to creating interactive games, is the book [Adventures in Minecraft](http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111894691X.html) by Martin O'Hanlon.
