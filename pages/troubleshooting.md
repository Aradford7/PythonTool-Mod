### Wait, what is a mod??
A great explanation can be found [here](http://minemum.com/what-are-mods).

### Cannot find my game files!
Have a look at this [link](http://minemum.com/game-files). It will point you to the default paths and explain how to access those paths. If you modified the game path when you installed it, you will have to remember that path, look for it, or uninstall and install Minecraft again.

### Not sure about Minecraft versions and profiles!
See if this [link](http://minemum.com/version-profiles) sheds some light! If unsure, just choose the last release, which is 1.10.2 at the time of writing this.

### A bit more detail on installing Forge mods?
Check this [guide](http://minemum.com/installing-mods)!

### Forge is throwing errors at me!
There's a great guide [here](http://minemum.com/troubleshooting-forge) which explains how to fix a number of common errors.

### PyCraft: "The mcpipy folder specified in PyCraft-Mod config menu does not exist. Please specify the correct folder!"
PyCraft cannot find the mcpipy folder in the path specified in the config menu. This folder is part of RaspberryJam Mod, so it can be that it hasn't been properly installed, check [Install RaspberryJam Mod](/installation#install-raspberryjam-mod). Or it can be that the folder is there but PyCraft is looking somewhere else: make sure that `mcpipy folder` is pointing to the right path, see the [Configure PyCraft!](/installation#configure-pycraft) step.

### PyCraft: "RaspberryJam Mod's mcpipy/mcpi is missing, replace or reinstall"
Part of RaspberryJam's installation files is corrupt: replace the `mcpipy` folder in Minecraft's installation directory as explained in [Install RaspberryJam Mod](/installation#install-raspberryjam-mod).

### PyCraft: "The personal folder specified in PyCraft-Mod config menu does not exist. Please specify the correct folder!"
The personal folder you have selected in PyCraft's config menu doesn't exist. Remember this folder is selected in PyCraft's config menu under the field `Script folder`, go type the right path!
