Just craft the Computer Block and place it in your world. It can also be found in the Miscellaneous creative tab.

The Computer Block looks at a given folder in your system (select it in PyCraft's mod config menu) where you will place your scripts: [create your own] or get dozens freely available online! Right-click on the Computer Block, you will see all those scripts in your folder as Script Items in the game, you can move them to your inventory or hot bar.

Equip and right-click a Script Item to get it running!

An arbitrary number of Python Scripts can be running at the same time. Right click on a Python Script will stop *all* running scripts *and* execute the new one. If you want to launch a new script and keep any previous ones running, use shift+right click (sneak click!). If you wish to just stop all running scripts without running a new one, you can type `/py` in the chat console.
